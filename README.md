# Spelling-Bee-Word-Game-Solver

After finishing a letter boxed solver, I was looking for a small side project to work on. 

Going into this, I think the logic for this should be easier than the Letter Boxes solver, in my mind it should be similar as to finding all the words needed for the letter boxed solver. (I could be wrong). 

The challenge for me going into this will be the CSS and seeing if I can create a way to input the letters in a way that makes the letters appear in the proper 'cell' as they are being entered. 

I have a few ideas as to how I may approach it using a 'onChange' function and splitting the input into an array allowing each letter to appear in a label as being entered. We shall see if my journey to the finished project takes me a different route. 

That is one of the main reasons for this app, practice coding, seeing if I can think through the project and pseudo code it out, and then see what challenges come my way.

I am looking forward to seeing what the end results look like (design wise and code wise.)
