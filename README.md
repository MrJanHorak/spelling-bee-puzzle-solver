After finishing a letter boxed solver, I was looking for a small side project to work on. I was spending alot of my time during the day learning and practicing DSAs. This project was what I did to wind down. It seemed to be a logical next step as I also spend some time each day trying to come up with words to solve the puzzle.

I used ReactJS 18, this is a Front-End only, web-app designed mobile first.

A challenge I faced while working on this project was how to enter letters in each cell most effeciently. I opted to have only one input field. It is located in the middle/yellow cell. However I have created a fake cursor and focus class in CSS to give the appearance of actually typing in each cell. 

## There are a few ice-box features: 

* When going backwards to correct an entry the focus doesn't change backwards.
* A second 'feature' to work on is that as you backspace to correct a mistyped letter, the old letter remains visible, even though slightly off center until a new letter is type.
* I really need to find a better word list with more common words, too many of the suggested words are not in the New York Times dictionary.
